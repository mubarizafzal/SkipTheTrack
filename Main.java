/**
 * This program is a simulator that shows how long the main hobo can survive jumping from track to track
 * 
 * The main hobo interacts with the following elements of the environment (in its attempt to survive):
 * 	- Trains
 * 		- determining timings for each track (negatively exponential)
 * 	- Other hobos
 * 		- message failure mechanism
 * 		- delay in message after sending
 * 		- chance of message being misread
 * 	-  Variable S, fixed value of how long the main hobo stays on one track before moving
 * 	- health and damage system
 * 
 * Learning rather than random jumping?
 *
